My Brother 420CN printer said Low Ink or No Ink on some cartridges and I
tried just pulling them out and putting them back in since they all
still had at least 1/2 a tank of ink.

After closing the cover, the LCD showed No Cartridge instead of asking
me which carts were replaced. I couldn't get rid of the message except
by unplugging the printer but then it went back to the No/Low errors.

The solution is to:

1.  Unplug printer
2.  Open and remove all carts
3.  Plug in with cover still open
4.  Look at the LCD messages and install the carts in the order it
    asks\*
5.  Close cover and say you replaced the carts it was complaining about
6.  If it says Please Wait for a long time, just Unplug and Replug

\* When you insert the cart it wants, if it is happy, the display will
ask you to install the next color. If it does not change, you have to
either replace the cartridge or cover up the ink sensor area of the cart
with about an inch of black electrical tape. The area to cover is the
end of the cartridge that has the 2 vertical indentations (when
installed into the printer, it is the end on the right). I tried
covering the center but that didn't work. I then tried the
leftÂ indentation (edge facing me) and that worked. You have to sort of
stuff the tape into the indentation.
