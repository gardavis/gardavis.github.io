A few months ago, I attended a PayPal Developers Days conference in
Miami. The seminar covered the various ways to integrate PayPal Pro into
your web site to accept payments. The options included using Express
Checkout which lets the user log on and choose a billing and shipping
address and a method of payment; Direct Pay which allows a web site to
accept credit cards cleared by PayPal without the customer having to
have a PayPal account and Standard Checkout which redirects the customer
to PayPal's site to log on and complete the payment. PayPal sends an IPN
(Instant Payment Notification) message to a web service-like page on
your site so you know you can proceed to fulfil the order.

I have been doing PayPal development for a long time so the test given
at the seminar was trivial - a few hours of refresher using the supplied
study guide were sufficient to quickly complete (and pass) the exam.
Eventually, I got listed on the [PayPal
Directory](http://www.paypal.com/Certification/dc_directory.html#Florida).

I also got a nice PayPal shirt:)
