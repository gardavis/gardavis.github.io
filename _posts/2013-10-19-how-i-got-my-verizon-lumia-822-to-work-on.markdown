I got a Nokia Lumia 822 Windows Phone as a developer promo and my wife
wanted to use it instead

of her Lumia 920 since it had most of the features but was a bit smaller
and a lot lighter in weight.

So I moved over the micro-sim card and everything worked fine except for
the data connection. The 822 is unlocked already so there was no need to
get an unlock code and unlock it from Verizon to use on AT&T.

To get the data to work, it is simply a matter of entering AT&T’s APN in
the Settings-\>Cellular-\>Add internet APN. For the APN field, enter
**wap.cingular**. No other fields need to be set. Finally, click on the
Save button.

That’s all there is to it! Now check your Internet access.
