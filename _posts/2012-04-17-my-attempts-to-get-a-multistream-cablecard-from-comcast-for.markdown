Unlike earlier Tivos, the Premiere requires a multistream cablecard
called an **M-Card**.

 

My first chat asked if I could pick up an M-Card self-install kit and
the operator said yes. I went to the Pompano office, stood in line an
hour and the counter person said that was not true. She wrote up the
initial order to send out the installer.

 

My second chat was to make sure the order had instructions to bring
M-Cards and not charge me for the installation. The chat person said she
added the info to the order.

 

The installer came last Wednesday with no M-Cards and nothing on the
order that said M-Cards were required for the Tivo Premiere.

 

I heard nothing for days so called and the operator set up the 2<sup>nd</sup>
appointment for today – it had to wait for M-Cards to be available.

 

As I said, the installer came today with no M-Cards and nothing on the
order that they were requested.

 

If things continue as they have, I will not hear again from the Comcast
installer (contractor) that went to get an M-Card.

 

We shall see.

***[Later that day…]***

Well we have success. An M-Card was located and installed without
incident. Contacting local Comcast supervisors may have helped – once
they got on board with the issue, they kept me in the loop with several
emails up through completion of the install.

Cablecard installation into Tivos (Series 3, HD Tivo and the new Tivo
Premiere) have had frequent problems, generally due to bad cards,
installers not familiar with Tivos and communications between the
installer and the service department that has to provision the cards.
