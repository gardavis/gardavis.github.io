My third WP7 app is now available in the Marketplace. Like the Tri-Rail
app I released a few weeks ago, this is a useful app for riders of the
Miami-Dade County Commuter Rail system known as [Miami's
Metrorail](javascript:void(0);/*1329950045759*/).

[![Miami's Metrorail App Home

app will let you locate the nearest stations using the WP7's GeoLocation
system to determine your current location. It will show the nearest
station North of you and the nearest station to the South including the
distance to the stations in miles.[![Miami's Metrorail App in the

The list of all stations can be displayed and select one to see the
details of that station such as the address and the times the trains
will arrive during the day. There is a button to click to display
directions to the station using Bing to help navigate you there.

The next arriving Northbound and Southbound trains are displayed with
the number of minutes until they arrive.

Select one of the stops at the station to see information about that
train and all its other station stops with arrival times.

There home screen has a button to display the Metrorail's mobile website
which is really nice and adds a lot of useful information. The station
information page displays connection informtion to local Metrobuses and
the Metromover.

Finally, there is an info screen that displays some information, web
page links and the About screen.

For more information, click the image to get to the marketplace and the
appâ€™s home page.
