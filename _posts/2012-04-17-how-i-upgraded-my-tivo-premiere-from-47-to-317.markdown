I posted over three years ago about my experiences in upgrading my HD
Tivo ([How I Upgraded my HD Tivo from 20 to 98
hours](/gary/archive/2007/08/18/how-i-upgraded-my-hd-tivo-from-20-to-98.aspx "Title of this entry."))
and since then, I moved my family room HD Tivo to the bedroom and
replaced it with a Tivo Premiere. Well, I started running low on space
so it is upgrade time again.

There are new tools to do the easy upgrade which I did yesterday. The
upgrade took four hours of which three hours were waiting for the
disk-to-disk copy to complete. Also, I recorded the project for YouTube.
