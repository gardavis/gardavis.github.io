Well, I have written my second WP7 app. This is a useful app for riders
of the S. Florida Commuter Rail system known as Tri-Rail (see
[http://www.tri-rail.com](http://www.tri-rail.com)).

[![Tri-Rail App Station

app will let you locate the nearest stations using the WP7's GeoLocation
system to determine your current location. It will show the nearest
station North of you and the nearest station to the South including the
distance to the stations in
miles.[![](/images/blogs_webguild_com/gary/DownloadTri-Rail.png)](http://garz.me/trirailapp)

The list of all stations can be displayed and select one to see the
details of that station such as the address and the times the trains
will arrive during the day. There is a button to click to display
directions to the station using Bing to help navigate you there.

The next arriving Northbound and Southbound trains are displayed with
the number of minutes until they arrive.
Select one of the stops at the station to see information about that
train and all its other station stops with arrival times.

There is a fare calculator that will determine the fare for the train
ride. Fares are based on the distance traveled (by zones), whether it is
a weekday or weekend rate and the type of travel (one-way, round trip or
one of several other types).

Finally, there is an info screen that displays some information, web
page links and the About screen.
For more information, click the image to get to the marketplace and the
appâ€™s home page.
