This is an email thread on my order of a JVC Receiver from eCost.com
(via Shop.com):

----

Thank you. Friday, I gave up waiting on eCost Customer Service and just
placed a second order to be overnighted. I received it the next day (a
Saturday). I appreciate the credit on the initial unreceived order. I
think eCost should credit me the shipping charge on the 2<sup>nd</sup> order
(about \$20) for all the grief I had, but I am not holding my breath.

 

The full odyssey of this incident will be published on my blog and/or
shopper forums – stay tuned.

 

Thanks again,

Gary Davis
