Subtext supports articles!
--------------------------

Articles are typically used for more traditional long-form style of
writing as you might find in a magazine article. They tend to cover more
timeless topics and do not show up in your main feed.

For example, you might write an “About Me” page as an article and then
link to it from the *News* section in the sidebar.

To create/edit/delete articles just visit the [articles section of the
admin](/admin/articles/ "Articles Section").
