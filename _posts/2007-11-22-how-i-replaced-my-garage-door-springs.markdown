After returning from dinner out one evening, my wife and I entered the
house and then heard a loud noise in the garage. We re-opened the door
and looked in and saw nothing out of place; no shelves crashed down nor
garden tools fell over.
 
 The next morning we found out what happened. The automatic garage door
opener would not open the door more than about a foot and then it
reversed. I disengaged the opener and tried to open the garage door
manually, but it seemed to be stuck. Then Deborah noticed that the right
torsion spring above the door was broken in two.

I described how I replaced the springs (with video) at this web page:
