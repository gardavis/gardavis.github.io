The [Big Brothers Big Sisters](http://www.bbbs.org/) app for the WP7
wasÂ created by a team of developers as part of the local Give
Camp project. I programmed the screens and web service calls; 
[Robert Hellestrae](http://www.roberthellestrae.com) did the initial foundation;
[Dave Norderer](http://www.computerways.com) did the shaker and spinner
coding as well as some of the REST data services. 

Several others were involved with the BBBS Little Moments web site and administration site
and project management. Our Big Brothers Big Sisters contact was 
[Kara Justi](http://www.mentorbig.org) from the Palm Beach and Marin Counties agency.

The WP7 version of the Big Brothers Big Sisters Little Moments app was
the first to market. The Android version is coming and as far as I know,
the iPhone version has no programmers or developers at this time. There
is also a website version under development (including an administration
section for adding/updating data) and has a REST web service for data
(BBBS agencies, activities, etc).

Get involved with Big Brothers Big Sisters and use this app to find
activities available within your selected price range, distance,
age-group and activity type for your selected local BBBS agency..
Activity providers have made special arrangements with your agency. 
You can shake your phone go get the unlocked spinners rolling and see if
the result finds an activity you and your "little" would enjoy. A locked
spinner can be either selected (meaning selected must match) or
unselected (meaning any will match). 
Click the search button to see the list ot matches and then click on a
match to find out the details of the activity. You can even get
directions from your location to the activity.
